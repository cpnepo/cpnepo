Hello everyone! Today I finally had time to explore GitHub and learn about it.
Maybe I'll look back to this first post and laugh at myself for being this noob.
I don't even know if I should use the newline character here. Anyways, I am still
happy to learn about making a branch, creating a pull request, and merging a pull
request today. This is my second "GitHub course" - how to make a GitHub page.

Hopefully, I will learn more as the days come. I am excited to finally call myself
a data scientist and I will start working soon. I hope by December, I already have a few
projects I shared here. 

Bye for now!
